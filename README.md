# Gabe's Old Stylophone DecentSampler Instrument

This is a hastily thrown together DecentSampler instrument sampled from my old Stylophone. There's samples recorded through direct input, as well as through the built in speaker, with and without the vibrato turned on.

The gain, chorus, and reverb effects are DecentSampler's own inbuilt effects. The orange keys denote the actual playable range of my Stylophone, but you can play beyond that range in this instrument if you want.

The samples and images were all created by me and I have licensed them under CC0 1.0, releasing them into the public domain. THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE SAMPLES AND IMAGES CONTAINED IN THIS REPO, IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE WHOLE DECENTSAMPLER PLUGIN, I DO NOT OWN DECENTSAMPLER NOR DO I HAVE ANY ROLE IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. The license also does not apply to anything you create with this instrument, you are free to license your own music however you wish, even if it uses my Stylophone samples.

## Installation Instructions:

Click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP" in the dropdown that appears. Extract the downloaded zip file, and move "GabesOldStylophone.dsbundle" to one of the following directories depending on what OS you're using.

NOTE: These are the default sample library directories for DecentSampler, if you set a custom one when you installed it, put the dsbundle in there, not in one of these.
