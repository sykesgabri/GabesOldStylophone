# Gabe's Old Stylophone DecentSampler Instrument

This is a hastily thrown together DecentSampler instrument sampled from my old ass Stylophone. There's samples recorded through direct input, as well as through the built in speaker, with and without the vibrato turned on.

The samples and images were all created by me and I have licensed them under CC0 1.0, releasing them into the public domain. THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE SAMPLES AND IMAGES CONTAINED IN THIS REPO, IT DOES NOT APPLY TO DECENTSAMPLER AS A WHOLE.
